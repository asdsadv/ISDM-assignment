### Objectives for New System Implementation:
The objective of this system update is to improve the operation of their in-house call management. This overall will adjust the amount of calls that can be taken as well as how quickly they can be resolved. Another use case of this will improve the sales on holiday packages. Overall achieving these objectives will further. There will need to be an analysis on how many use cases there are in regard to the new system and how many of them will be new and vital over the current system. Our goal will be to design and build an agile scalable system to allow for a lot of room for the system to cope in the event of a large back up of calls. The overall goal is to filter customers to the best fitted Relationship Manager (RM). This will further enhance the efficiency of how each RM can assign a customer with their holiday packages. An improvement of this will then lead to a lot of wasted time being used efficiently as there will be less time needed to sort and filter customers or to even randomly assign the customer to a different RM every time.

### Stakeholders: 
When assessing the stakeholders that are needed to take into consideration with the implementation of such a large system-based project, we broke our findings down to identifying stakeholders into two different groups. These groups are internal stakeholders and external stakeholders.

| Internal Stakeholders| External Stakeholders |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
|Employees managing the calls in the call centre | End customers |
|Analytics managers|Public who display interests|
|Project managers |Hotels and other accommodation companies within the holiday packages|
|Relationship Managers |Hire companies eg cars, boats, bikes etc|
|Other branches of the company – Relationship managers and call centre (CMC) |The Third-party travel related companies|
|generalised employees with the company ||
|HR dealing with internal disputes in the duration of the project  ||
|Shareholders (though there is a difference, shareholders may still be classified as a stakeholder in this instance)||

### Planned Approach:
We would like to aim for a simplified approach to meet not only stakeholders’ requirements but any future stakeholders that may have some form of association with the company in the future. The process will be done through a thorough planning and testing stage. There will need to be an analysis on the old system and the need to identify if the system needs to be updated and remodelled or if there are completely new areas that need to be built within the system or the whole system itself. I would suggest a pilot implementation of the new system once ready to ensure that it works correctly and can run smoothly while achieving the goal it is designed to achieve. Using the 5 stages of design thinking, we will follow the process as necessary. The stages of this design thinking are to Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test. 
These stages fit the approach to have a pilot test of the product in regard to how the product will be implemented.

### The Agile Methodologies - 
When looking at the movement on what is most cost effective and scalable in a business. Its safe to assume that taking an agile method approach would be best suited for this project and development of the new software/system. This will allow for responsive changes if there is any need  for some. By making the project as agile as possible. We can assume that there will be a good balance of both development guidelines and philosophy. This will include things like a well presented delivery of analysis and design as well as active and consistent communication across the board. This will also secure and assure customer satisfaction and smaller project teams who are able to collaborate in a better space. The process for the systems implementation will require a well laid out process and documentation of the projects stakeholders which can consist of managers, system users and customers. An agile approach will identify a customers needs and what is required as well as recognise that plans can be short lived. This also helps for development of software and can deliver the software in increments.
An agile approach should allow for the fast and quick progression of team organisation as well as communication in order to complete tasks. Our approach for this system would be to take the task at hand and partition the project into parts to ensure a level of satisfaction and requirements completion through the use of prototypes that are developed throughout the making and implementation of the system. 
This agile approach will also address multiple risks that consist of but are not limited to; Schedule slips, cancelation of the project, system eros, defect rates, misunderstandings of the business or businesses purpose, changes in the business small or large and staff turnovers if needed.
Looking further into agile methods we have addressed the use of a scrum approach to complete the requirements needed.

### Scrum -
 When looking at a scrum agile approach for the development of this software and project, it is easy to identify that this is a very heavily team based project that will allow for segmented teams to deliver the product in short cycles which will enhance the production rate and quality of the software/project. A scrum approach will also allow for fast constant feedback. This will allow for a consistent improvement as well as the ability to scale the project up or down based on demand if need be. This will allow the business the ability to change and adapt quickly to any major changes that may be involved. 
This methodology has proven to have worked many times and is perfect for this project as the software is complex and may need to be changed at a moment's notice. This will further enhance the ability to adapt for changes that may be needed to be made to the system in order to tailor it better for not only the CMC but RM’s as well to further enhance a more pleasurable experience for the customer.

### Assumptions made in the systems analysis. 
 
The agile and scrum methodology can be applied to this project. It is very appropriate because we can complete the project effectively and revise it many times so that it can complete the project well without any mistakes and reduce error. This system can also be adjusted to CMC and RM to provide the services that customers want. Such system assumptions of our projects are listed below:
1.  Assume that the system will be used to design and analyse in strengthening active communication and consistency in working on projects.
2.  Assume that the system can secure and guarantee the satisfaction of customers and smaller project teams that are able to collaborate in a better space.
3. The process of project stakeholders who are managers, system users, and customers must implement organizational development and rapid team communication, so that they can complete tasks well.
4.  The leader can share the project with the team to deliver products or services in a short cycle that will increase the level of production and the quality of our project.
5. 	Continuous feedback from leaders makes the business’s ability to change and adapt quickly to any major changes involved in the project.

### Competitive advantages to be gained, Possible adverse effects for the business if this system project fails.
